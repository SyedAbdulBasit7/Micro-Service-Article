    <h2>Before Microservices - Monolithic Architecture:</h2>

    <p>
        Monolithic architecture used as  a big container where all the Software applications and  components are connected and assembled together and each components depend on each other so if we change one component that infected or damage other components. It makes a development really easy in one direction and increase the security of software.</p>

<h2>Why We Do Not Use To Monolithic Architecture:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><h3>Large and complex application:</h3>
        The large application is really complex to understand and modify such application.
    </li>
    <li><h3>Slow Development:</h3>
        Because it can be difficult to understand, how to correctly implement a change and due
        to that the quality of code declines over time
    </li>
    <li><h3>Blocks Continuous Development:</h3>
        Large monolithic application is an obstacle to frequent deployments, in order to update
            one component you have to redeploy the entire application which interrupts the
            background task.
    </li>
    <li><h3>Unsalable:</h3>
        Because of the tightly coupled components, if one of them goes down the entire system
            fail to run.
    </li>
    <li><h3>Unreliable:</h3>
        The large application is really complex to understand and modify such application.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Microservices Architecture:</h2>

<p id="ms">Microservices are an architectural approach to building applications. As an architectural
    framework, micro services are distributed and loosely coupled, so one team’s changes won’t
    break the entire app. <br/> The benefit to using micro services is that development teams are able to rapidly build new
    components of apps to meet changing business needs. One each micro service can focus on
    only one single business capability which definitely leads to a better quality.</p>

    <h2>Features of Microservices Architecture:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Small Focused:</h3>
            It can be re-written and maintained without any extra efforts by the development team.     
        </li>
        <li><h3>Loosely Coupled:</h3>
            Because each micro service is independent to each other and do not need to code, so if
                you have to update a particular service, it will only update that service, so a deployment
                becomes really quick. 
        </li>
        <li><h3>Language Neutral:</h3>
            It must be language nuisance, for example in an application few services can be written
                in python for fast development, whereas few might be written in java because its speed
                and extensive libraries, so depend on the micro services what kind of programming
                language we are using, so it does not really effect the other services.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Bounded Context:</h3>
            Each micro service does not need to understand the implementation of other
                micro services. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantage of Microservices:</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Independent Development</li>
    <li>Independent Deployment</li> 
    <li>Fault Isolation</li>
    <li>Mixed Technology Stack</li>
    <li>Granular Scaling</li>
    </ul>
